- The Marshall Plan was a strategic plan created by the United States to aid in the reconstruction efforts of the [[WWII and Its Impact#^559872|Allied nations]] and some [[WWII and Its Impact#^891e89|Axis nations]]
- It recognized that the economic stability and recovery of Europe were crucial not only for the well-being of the continent but also for global peace and stability.
- It was named after George Marshall, the then US Secretary of State
- It was drafted on June 5, 1947 at a meeting of the participating European states
- The USSR and its allies were offered aid as well, but they refused under pressure from Joseph Stalin
- The US provided approximately $13 billion (almost $150 billion today) in aid to 17 European countries. This aid came in the form of grants, technical expertise, and essential goods
- However, the plan had certain conditions attached, including requirements for the nations involved to cooperate with each other in allocating resources and adopting economic policies
- A secret motive of the plan may have been to counter the spread of communism in Europe. By providing an alternative to USSR influence in the region, the plan laid the groundwork for the NATO alliance and broader US strategy during the Cold War
