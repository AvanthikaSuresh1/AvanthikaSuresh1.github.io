The need for efficient production processes to aid in post-war recovery led to advancements in industrial automation. Technologies such as programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and numerical control systems were developed. Innovations like the transistor and the integrated circuit paved the way for smaller, more affordable, and more reliable electronic devices, including radios, televisions, and the earliest computers.
