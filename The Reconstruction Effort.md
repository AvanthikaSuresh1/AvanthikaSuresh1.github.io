European and Asian nations were ravaged by the war, and in the post-war period, faced an array of challenges in order to rebuild their economies. The destruction left cities turned to rubble, ruined existing industries, and destroyed most infrastructure.

However, the resilience and determination of these nations paved way for reconstruction efforts. Some of the challenges they faced were:
- **Infrastructural ruin:** Houses, roads, bridges, etc. were decimated after the war as a result of bombings and artillery fire
- **Displaced populations:** Millions were displaced from their countries during the war and needed to be resettled
- **Wartime financial debt:** During the war, many nations took loans to fund the fighting and as such, were burdened with substantial debt. At the time, economic inflation was rampant and currencies were being devalued by the minute
- **Depletion of resources:** The war drained human as well as natural resources. Chemical warfare led to poisoned water, wartime strategies had cleared out swathes of forest area, and the amount of able-bodied people were reduced drastically due to the war efforts

In order to overcome these challenges, a variety of strategies were deduced to aid in the reconstruction efforts. The first and foremost of these was the Marshall Plan
