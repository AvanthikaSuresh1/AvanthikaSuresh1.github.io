The IMF or International Monetary Fund was created to promote global monetary cooperation and aid in the stabilization of exchange rates. It is one of the two Bretton Woods Institutions along with the [[World Bank]]. Its key functions are:
	1. Monitor developments in finance and economics around the world
	2. Provide loans and financial support to its member states that face balance of payment issues
	3. Offer advice and expertise on economic reform and drafting of policies

Many countries in Europe and Asia were ruined by WWII. The IMF provided financial aid and its expertise to the post-war reconstruction efforts of these countries and helped rebuild and stabilize their economies.
